        <p><b>Currently, I work as a staff member at a university.</b> I'm still a newbie but I enjoy the work I do. Right now, I'm learning a few
            programming languages aside from my typical workload so I can support my team and better the quality of my work. Maybe I can also 
            do something on the side with these newfound skills in the future.</p>
        <p>Update: It has been more than two handfuls of months, and I am still learning new things every week.</p>
